Four m-files that extend MATLAB's gamma functions to complex arguments
and perform the translation from Mathematica's to MATLAB's versions of
gamma functions.

GAMMAZ		same as GAMMA, but possibly complex arguments
GAMMAIZ		same as GAMMAINC,        -"-
GAMMALNZ	same as GAMMALN,         -"-
GAMATH		same as GAMMA in Mathematica (several sub-definitions
		  for 1, 2, or 3 (possibly complex) arguments).

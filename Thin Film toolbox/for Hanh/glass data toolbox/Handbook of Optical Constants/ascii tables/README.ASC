INTRODUCTION TO THE FILES 

     After HOCI was published in 1985, I received a few inquiries
about putting the tables of n and k on floppy disks.  I had not
asked the critiquers to supply me with such disks.  For HOCII
published in 1991 I did ask the critiquers to put the n and k
data on disks.  While I did supply a few scientists with disks of
the tables in HOCII, they did not receive wide distribution.  
     In 1993 I approached Frank Harris and Dr. Jean M. Bennett of
the Optical Society of America and volunteered to re-edit all the
tables in HOCI and HOCII into a more useful format for plotting
and manipulating purposes.  With permission from Academic Press,
all the tables from HOCI and a few from HOCII were laser scanned,
and these were added to my original collection from HOCII.   
     All tables were prepared into files in WP5.1 format and then
converted to ASCII format.  In the process, the decimal or left
tabs which define the five to nine columns are lost; this
includes the tabs which delineate empty columns.  Also, for wide
tables with 6-9 vertical columns, the standard left and right
margins of 1" have been reduced to 0.5".  This sometimes causes
problems with the far right column when converting to ASCII and
printing out the table.  A smaller font size can alleviate this
problem.  Superscripts and subscripts in the file headings have
been put on the line in WP5.1, as they convert to the line in
ASCII anyway.  The Greek mu often converts intact.  For the
reference titles, superscripts and subscripts have been used in
WP5.1; they convert to the line in ASCII. 
     These files in WP or ASCII format can be exported to a
spread sheet, edited, and plotted.     
     The references in the critiques of HOCI and HOCII, from
which the numbers in the tables were extracted, are presented in
separate files REFHOCI.WP and REFHOCII.WP.  The titles of the
references have been included to give the reader an idea of the
specific spectral region.  For more details, it will be necessary
to return to the original HOCI and HOCII.
     Additional new or overlooked papers for the materials in
HOCI and HOCII have been put into a file NEWREFS.WP without
comment.  These may be of interest for updating a table yourself. 
     While the conversion from eV to cm-1 was 8065.48 eV/cm-1 at
the time of HOCI, some of the critiquers used slightly different
values, such as 8065.5 and 8065.  This does not affect experiment
very much, however, because most physicists do not measure
wavelength to four or more figures.  We tried to give the
experimental unit to four or fewer figures and then the other two
units to four figures, so that the reader could spot the units in
which the original experiments had been done.  This is not
obvious in some of the tables where some units are given to five
figures on occasion.  Then translating between the units and
rounding off to four figures can become a problem.  Sometimes, we
have added a significant figure at 1000, 100, 10, 1 eV, etc., in
the adjacent cm-1 column to indicate which conversion factor was
used by the critiquer.
     All cm-1 columns (often left blank above 50000 in HOCI and
HOCII) have been completed, even though it is hard to think in
terms of a number like 12586000 cm-1 (waves per cm). 
     Exponential notation has been filled in for the extinction
coefficient, whereas it was omitted until the exponent changed in
HOCI and HOCII.  While k has been given to as many as four
figures, it is probably no better than two figures at any time.
     While the bulk of the tables in HOCI and HOCII start at high
eV and then descend, occasionally, a table starts at low eV and
rises.  We have sorted these few tables, so that all eV now run
from high to low.  Also, while most of the unit columns are eV,
cm-1, Êm in HOCI and HOCII, occasionaly, the cm-1 and Êm columns
were reversed.  Now they all have been made consistent.  You may
want to convert to èngstroms or nanometers in appropriate
spectral regions.
     All the reference brackets in the original tables have been
removed and put into each file heading; footnotes have been
removed completely.  The reference numbers pertinent to each
table (file) are given in the heading of each file.      
     Some of the numbers in the files have been rearranged for
better continuity and to save space.  In overlap regions there
are sometimes large discrepancies between data from different
laboratories.  You will have to read the original text to
discriminate if the original critiquer has not done this for you.
     When two or three different crystal forms of a material were
given in the same table in HOCI and HOCII, e.g., ZnS, we have now
made separate files for ZnS-cubic, ZnS-hexagonal, ZnS-irtran. 
This is especially necessary for the alloy semiconductors PbSnTe,
HgCdTe, AlGaAs as each is really a "different" material.
     The few non-room-temperature values for a few materials in
the original tables have been omitted from the files.
     In some of the files for birefringent materials and
deposited materials, the columns are sometimes interrupted by a
new set of eV, cm-1, Êm, n, k columns to list the ordinary and
extraordinary n's and k's or a new set of deposition parameters.  
     Errors and typos in the original tables, found by me or
reported to me by others, have been corrected.
     The index of files presented below lists the file name, the
crystal form of the material, page on which the original table
started in HOCI and HOCII, the left and right margin dimensions,
the Lft (left) or Dec (decimal) tab.  Usually metals,
semiconductors and dielectrics deposited on substrates are
polycrystalline or amorphous in form (except for epitaxy).  Most
metals are cubic but are labeled poly-x, because they were
deposited in some fashion.  Differences in optical constants
between crystalline and polycrystalline material are mostly due
to the deposition process.  Some materials are amorphous.
     While the tables of metals, semiconductors and insulators in
HOCI and HOCII are nominally alphabetized by the name of the
material, the file names are listed by chemical symbol and
alphabetized accordingly.  The files for HOCI are on disk 1,
HOCII on disk 2 and the remainder of HOCII and README.WP,
REFHOCI.WP, REFHOCII.WP and NEWREFS.WP on disk 3.
